We had an Idea a while ago... Maybe we should start talking about the **GIANT** **Elephant** in the room, Quantum Computers and the implications to all modern cryptography in use today. 

There are some definite calls to action out there from some large and important bodies related to the security and privacy of information that is shared and distributed. However we also find that a lot of industry is simply unwilling to look at the severity of the issue and take forward steps to solve it today.

We need to move on the next form of secure cryptography. 

## Our Mission here

TheQRL.info was established as a blog to collect information and content related to the problem, and more importantly, the solutions that are being developed. There is currently a push by multiple nation states and large corporations to develop an efficient and practical quantum computer to shift the paradigm of information.  

The large players that have been collecting information and storing what we think now to be secure communication, soon this will not be the case. The idea of retroactively decrypting and implicating whistle blowers or undercover agents, even to your neighbors mistress... everything changes. 

The sooner we can move to a new system, the better. So we actively pursue the latest information, engage with the smartest minds, and challenge everyone to begin thinking about the future. 

**What can you do to change things for the better?**

### Working Implimentations

The Quantum Resistant Ledger is the only working, quantum resistant project utilizing XMSS, one of the current implementations being considered by NIST in a challenge to find the next forms of cryptography used widely.
