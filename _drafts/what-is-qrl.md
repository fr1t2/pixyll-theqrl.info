summary: It's all in the title, what is QRL.

QRL stands for Quantum Resistant Ledger, a decentralized cryptocurrency operating on a P2P network. You could relate QRL to Bitcoin in some ways, like the constantly building block chain and consensus algorithms. 

The QRL howerver differs from Bitcoin in a spectacular way, the cryptography that underpins the workings is drastically different. QRL uses XMSS or eXtendable Merkel Signature Scheme as the behind the scenes math that secures message signatures for transactions on the chain. 

Because QRL uses this novel scheme for signing on-chain and the very cool way the cryptography works the transactions and private keys are thought to be Quantum Resistant. 

In other words a quantum computer with enough power to break most actively used cryptography won't touch the algorithm QRL uses. 

QRL has some other cool uses like document notarization, messaging on chain, and soon to have the ability to run code verified on the chain or Project Silicone.

### The Ledger

The QRL is a ledger of transactions all hashed and signed by various addresses (wallets) held by users. These transactions are transmitted using a computer connected to the P2P network. 

This all happens behind the scenes using the wallet application either on your phone, computer or web. You simply enter the amount to send and where to send it (the other address). 

Your wallet then signs that transaction and sends it on to be mined into a block. Miners then pickup this special signed message from you and add it to the block chain forever, enscripted mathematically forever.

Once in the block chain and accepted by a majority of nodes running the QRL software your message can forever be verified by searching the block chain using the explorer. 

The other address also sees the transaction on the block chain and recieves the Quanta
